# Statistical-Learning---Model-Selections

# This assignment was done in the class STA4241 - Statistical Learning. In this assignment, data was randomly generated, and a population model was built using this data plus a random error. The population model took the form of y = 10 + 4x + 2(x^2) + (x^3) + e, with e being a random error. The population model was then predicted using backwards, forward, and best selection, as well as lasso regression. A transformation of the x variable was considered from the 1st degree to the 10th degree. The number of parameters used was determined by the graphs of the the adjusted r^2, BIC, and Cp. This was then repeated with a different population model -> y = 10 + 2*(x^7) + e. Best selection and lasso regression were used to build the prediction models.
